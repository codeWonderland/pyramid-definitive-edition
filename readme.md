This is The Pyramid: Definitive Edition, an indie and roguelike roulette challenge game. The general idea is that you can draft challenge runs for games you already have. Starting as a Tabletop Simulator mod created by Olexa, The Pyramid: Definitive Edition is now a full standalone application. Draft games you want to play, then do challenges and score points in your favorite indie and roguelike games. Featuring over 100 unique and custom decks, over 2000 custom cards, 200+ games represented, and more.
